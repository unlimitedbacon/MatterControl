Contributing to MatterControl on Github
=======================================

Github is a place for developer discussion. If you have a question or need help using MatterControl, please either post on the [MatterControl Forum](http://forums.matterhackers.com/category/20/mattercontrol) or send an email to support@matterhackers.com. If you are unsure if the problem you are having is really a bug, then send us an email. We will be happy to investigate and file a bug report if necessary.

This is not the place for rants or abusive posts. We welcome constructive criticism, but if you feel the need to vent, please do it elsewhere.

Bug Reports
-----------

* If you have never filed a bug report for software before, [read this](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).
* Reports should only deal with a single bug at a time. Do not submit a laundry list of issues.
* Search for existing bugs before posting. Be sure to search for closed issues as well. If your issue is already known to us, it will be marked as a duplicate and closed.
* Use correct English and read your post aloud to yourself before submitting it. Avoid inflamatory language.
* Please use a clear descriptive title.
  * Examples of good titles:
    * "Can't close MC without stopping print from SD Card"
    * "Add support for Monoprice Maker Select Mini firmware"
  * Examples of bad titles:
    * "This product is bad and you should feel bad"
* Include clear step by step instructions to reproduce the issue. Remember, **the developers cannot fix the bug if we cannot get it to happen ourselves**.
* Include a screenshot of the problem, if applicable.
* Please attach a .zip to your issue with any applicable diagnostic files. See the wiki article on [gathering diagnostic information](http://wiki.mattercontrol.com/Send_Debugging_Information). These might include...
  * Crash Logs
  * .stl files
  * .gcode files
  * Exported slice settings (.printer file)
  * Print Logs
